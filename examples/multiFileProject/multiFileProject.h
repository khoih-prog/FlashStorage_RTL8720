  For Realtek RTL8720DN, etc. using Flash

  The FlashStorage_RTL8720DN library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory
  of RTL8720DN, etc.. It's using the buffered read and write to minimize the access to Flash.
  It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.
